# Digital Tools for Data-Driven Investigation

In this session we will explore the basics of web-architecture and see how websites are built. This will involve opening up chrome's developer tools in the browser to see how websites are structured. We will also discuss what makes for a well structured data driven web app, learn how to hit an API for data, and host a simple website of our own on github. We will also go through some examples of how to extract data from websites, how to find data behind a chart if it is on the page, and how to discover hidden or undocumented APIs.
