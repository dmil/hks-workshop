# Unpacking Websites & Hunting for Data

This session will involve opening up chrome's developer tools in the browser to see how websites are structured. We will also go through some examples of how to extract data from websites, how to find data behind a chart if it is on the page, and how to discover hidden or undocumented APIs. Some examples will be drawn from previous FiveThirtyEight stories.
